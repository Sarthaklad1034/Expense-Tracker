# Expense-Tracker
Expense Tracker, also known as Expense Manager and Money Manager, is a desktop application or software allowing users to record their money inflow and outflow accurately.

This project aims to build an Expense Tracker based on GUI. In order to build this, we will require an intermediate knowledge and understanding of the Tkinter library, SQL language and its commands, and fundamental knowledge of different modules of the Tkinter library and the tkcalendar library.
